INSERT INTO `games` VALUES (1,'Minecraft is a game which mixes elements of sandbox, survival horror and construction game. It is an evolved version of Minecraft Classic.  As in Minecraft Classic the player is dropped in a randomly generated world made out of cubes. Unlike the classic version where the player can add and remove blocks at will, in this version all blocks the player wants to place must first be \"mined\" elsewhere. Some materials require special equipment to be mined. Stone requires a wooden pick axe to be mined; gold requires an iron pick axe and obsidian requires a diamond pick axe. The player can also create shovels and normal axes to mine sand, dirt and wood faster. Mining is no longer instant but requires the player to hit the block a couple times, tools reduce the time.  Some blocks can not be found in nature but require crafting. Clay, for example, can be split into clay balls, which when baked turn into bricks which can be combined to form brick wall blocks. Baking happens in a stone oven, which requires a steady supply of coal and the oven itself needs to be crafted at a workbench, which needs to be constructed first.  This time the player(s) are not alone. During the day pigs, chickens, cows and sheep roam the land. Some of them, when killed or struck, will drop valuable items such as leather required for protective clothing or pork chops which when baked can heal the player. But at night and in the dark randomly generated caverns monsters rule the land. There are various different monsters, including the zombie, a skeleton archer, an exploding creeper, deadly spiders and gelatinous cubes. Aside from randomly spawning in dark areas, they also spawn in so-called \"mob spawners\" which spawn enemies indefinitely until properly illuminated or destroyed. To defend himself against enemies the player can craft weapons such as a sword and bow, and protective clothing to reduce damage. When the player dies his items are dropped at the place of his death, but the player respawns at his original spawn point. Items can be recovered if the player reaches them within five minutes (unless they fell into lava).','Action','images/game_image__Minecraft.jpg','June 30th, 2010','Minecraft',8),(2,'Fortnite Battle Royale is the completely free 100-player PvP mode in Fortnite.

The teams are then awarded with money and the next round starts. Money can be used to purchase new weapons and equipment at the start of each round. If you die, then you will lose the equipment you bought in the next round. Aside from playing online, the player can also decide to play an offline game with AI-controlled bots or go through a weapons course.

One touch from any of these ghosts means loss of a life for Pac-Man.  Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating one of the four Power-Pills located around the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.

While the originals were set within Greek mythology, the new title takes place after the original games within the world of Norse mythology. Kratos now resides in Midgard along with his son Atreus. After encountering a mysterious stranger covered in tattoos, Kratos and Atreus set out on a long and dangerous journey through the Nine Realms to scatter his dead wife\'s ashes from atop the highest mountain peak in Midgard.  Unlike the original games, God of War utilizes a freely controllable third-person camera. Kratos now makes use of the Leviathan Axe, which has frost-damaging capabilities to freeze enemies in place, and can be thrown and summoned back to Kratos\' hand at will. Kratos also has a shield that can be used to block and parry incoming attacks. Kratos can also use his fists to attack enemies, this can stun enemies and allows Kratos to execute finishing moves. In addition, his son Atreus can fire arrows at enemies and summon animals. Attacking enemies and collecting certain items raises Kratos\' rage meter. After it is full, Kratos can use Spartan Rage, which greatly increases his attack power and speed, making him virtually unstoppable for a short time.  In addition to combat, Kratos can also use the axe for puzzle solving, by freezing certain mechanisms in place, or destroying runes to unlock chests.','Action','images/game_image__GodofWar.jpg','April 20th, 2018','God of War',12),(6,'Two hundred years after the events described in Oblivion, the continent of Tamriel is in turmoil. The Emperor\'s throne remained without heir; the Blades, Empire\'s elite guards, have been disassembled; elven nations began capturing territory from the Empire. The assassination of the King of Skyrim, Tamriel\'s Northern-most province and home of the Nord race, led to a civil war between those who wish independence for Skyrim and those who wanted it to remain under the Empire\'s control.  A prisoner is brought to a small town, awaiting execution for alleged involvement with the Stormcloaks, a group that was founded by the king\'s assassin Ulfric Stormcloak. Just before the executioner\'s axe lands on the prisoner\'s neck, a dragon attacks the city, forcing most people to flee. The unexpected freedom leads the ex-prisoner into the snowy Skyrim, where the rumors of the dragon begin to circulate.  Like its predecessors in the Elder Scrolls series, Skyrim is an open-ended role-playing game with action-based combat. The player may explore the vast environments of Skyrim from either first- (default) or third-person perspective, being unrestricted in his or her travels and free to undertake any side quests in any order, or follow the main quest. It is possible to fast-travel to previously visited locations directly from the world map.

The game is mainly browser based, but requires a separate installer for the PC platforms to play or edit, while the mobile versions integrate everything into a single app, but do not provide access to the editor.  The game contains two types of currencies: tickets and Robux. Tickets are the most common and these are earned by participating in activities. Robux is the premium currency. It is used to customize the avatar extensively and buy and sell items. Players can design new items and trade or sell them. It is also possible to implement small fees for games so players have to pay to participate.

It centers around three protagonists: Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. New to the series is that the player can switch between the three characters on the fly. They each have different missions, lives, and personalities. They also often come together, especially for heists, a complex type of mission where a large operation needs to be planned and executed by determining a strategy and hiring additional henchmen. As with previous games in the series, the gameplay involves gunfights and takes place in a sprawling, open-world city where players get around by acquiring transport (cars, boats, helicopters, etc) through less than legal means. Players can roam the game world, complete story missions, and partake in various illegal activities, including shooting civilians, robbing people, destruction of cars, and the titular act of car theft. These lead to a wanted rating of up to five stars, sending in a police force in pursuit. Continuing to resist the police will also increase it. The wanted status is lost by getting out of sight or by spraying the car.','Action','images/game_image__Gta5.jpg','September 17th, 2013','Grand Theft Auto V',16),(10,'Runeterra is a world full of magic. But not in an esoteric or invisible kind of way. No, the magic is real. It can be formed, sculpted, manipulated and such. And no where on Runeterra is the concentration and accessibility of magic so high as in Valoran. There a nexus can be used to transform the raw magic into a physical form to make it usable. But as useful that may be on first glance, in reality the abundance of raw energy has always been a threat to the very existence of Runeterra. It\'s a very unstable world with seismic disturbances and every kind of geological areas scattered around the surface of the planet. In addition many used the raw energy in their wars without regard to the consequences of their actions. The last two rune-wars alone changed the face of Valoran completely and even when the raw energy had been turned to restoration after the people realized they terrible mistake, the changes continued to go on. A theory says that another rune-war will destroy the whole world from within.  In order to prevent that from happening, the League of Legends was formed. Their entire purpose is to oversee the controlled resolution of the political conflicts in Valoran. To that end it was decided that all important conflicts have to be resolved inside specific arenas build at various places in Valoran. Summoners of a political group are now allowed to announce one champion each to resolve their conflict in these arenas.

PLAYERUNKNOWN aka Brendan Greene, is a pioneer of the Battle Royale genre.

It is a vehicle based, futuristic variant of football (soccer). Just like the original game it is played in a large arena with two teams of cars. As with football the goal is to score by launching a giant ball into the goal of the opposing team. The arena has curved edges with large walls, so the ball cannot leave the pitch and bounces back, and it is possible to drive up the sides.  Cars have no means of attack and no health bar, but it is possible to ram other cars to hinder them. Vehicles also have the ability to jump and use nitro. Nitro boosts are limited, but can be refilled by driving over certain sections of the pitch. By winning matches experience is earned to level up and unlock new parts. The car can be fully customized in a garage with different types of bodies, colours, wheels, decals, nitro trails etc. which is new for this version. Next to one-time exhibition matches and online games, it has a full season mode. The player sets up a season and determines the length (number of weeks), difficulty (rookie, pro, all-star), play-offs and the team size, with multiple matches in succession. Matches generally last five minutes.','Sports','images/game_image__RocketLeague.jpg','July 7th, 2015','Rocket League',19),(14,'In the near future of our world, an uprising of artificially intelligent robots led the United Nations to form Overwatch, an international task force of the best and brightest \"scientists, soldiers, adventurers, and oddities\" in order to combat the threat. After the war, Overwatch was dedicated to peacekeeping and scientific progress, and became a symbol of hope around the world. However, many years of controversy and waning influence came to a head when the UN launched an investigation into alleged human rights violations, which was shortly thereafter followed by an explosion that claimed Overwatch HQ and the lives of two of its most prominent members. This led to the disbanding of the organization. Now a number of heroes from a variety of organizations and walks of life have come together to fill the void Overwatch left.  Overwatch is a first-person shooter in which two teams of six players each battle to complete objectives or hinder their opponents from doing such. Playable heroes are divided into four classes based broadly on the role they are meant to play: offense, defense, tank, and support. Each hero has their own unique abilities and gameplay mechanics, and players can switch to a different hero mid-match in order to better aid their team. Objectives are different on each map, and can include overseeing the delivery of a payload object to a specific location, capturing or defending specific areas of the map, or a combination of the two.','Action','images/game_image__OverWatch.jpg','May 23rd, 2016','Overwatch',24),(15,'In the year 1960, a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will built in the 1940s by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack\'s main motivation while he tries to survive the horrors that free will can create.  BioShock is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once-proud social experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950s.  The game\'s plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture\'s inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to System Shock games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements that further tie BioShock to its spiritual predecessors.','Action','images/game_image__Bioshock.jpg','August 2007 ','BioShock',22),(16,'Dota 2 is the official sequel to Defense of the Ancients, a fan-made map of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, introducing an extensive selection of new heroes and items.

Each team consists of a party of heroes and supporting non-player characters (NPCs) known as creepers. The player controls one these heroes, together with other heroes and creepers, attempt to push forward into enemy territory while also coordinating defense against enemy intrusions. Creepers on both sides continually respawn and will gradually increase in numbers and strength as the game progresses. Fallen heroes will suffer a timeout and will eventually respawn at the starting location.  Heroes acquire experience during combat, simply by being in the area when an adjacent enemy falls. Slightly more experience is awarded if the hero deals the killing blow. Sufficient experience allows the player\'s hero to level up and choose new skills, consisting of three basic skills and one unique expert skill after the hero has reached level 6. Each skill may also be increased in its level as the hero gains more levels. Some skills may require specific items before it can be upgraded.

As rows are cleared, the pace of the game increases, the background changes, and the game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.  The game is very similar to Nintendo\'s own NES version of the game, featuring the same \"Type A\" endless and \"Type B\" set-clear modes. The game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable.

Both races and classes have unique abilities, skills, and spells to help them survive in the world.  The game offers professions for players to learn, if they want. You have the choice of 2 major professions, such as Alchemy, Herbalism, Skinning, and Tailoring, as well as the ability to have unlimited minor professions, such as Fishing and Cooking. Progressing in these skills allows you to make more things or have better results from the skills.  The gameplay is similar to most other MMORPG games, where you must go out into the world, complete quests, kill monsters, and level up your character.
